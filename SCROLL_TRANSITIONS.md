- Opposite direction of wipe-left
- **Used for**: Quote Section

### 4. **Slide Up** (`slide-up`)

## Technical Implementation

### GSAP ScrollTrigger
- All transitions use GSAP ScrollTrigger for smooth scroll-based animations
- `scrub: 1` creates smooth scrubbing effect tied to scroll position
- Triggers activate at `top 80%` (when section enters viewport)
- Completes at `top 20%` for full reveal

### Performance
- Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Optimized scroll listeners
- Minimal repaints and reflows

### Key Features
- **Continuous scroll**: No snapping, natural scroll flow
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth scrubbing**: Transitions tied to scroll progress
- **Alternating effects**: Each section has different transition for visual variety

## Usage

```tsx
import { ScrollSection } from '@/components/scroll/ScrollSection'

<ScrollSection transitionType="split">
  <YourContent />
</ScrollSection>
```

## Customization

Edit `/components/scroll/ScrollSection.tsx` to:
- Adjust transition timing (change `duration`)
- Modify trigger points (change `start` and `end`)
- Add new transition types
- Customize animation easing

- GSAP ScrollTrigger demos
- Award-winning creative studio websites
