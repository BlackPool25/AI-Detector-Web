# React Three Fiber Version Compatibility Fix

## Issue
Runtime error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')`

This error occurred in `react-reconciler` because React Three Fiber v9 requires React 19, but the project uses React 18.

## Root Cause
React Three Fiber v9.x requires React 19.x, but this Next.js project is using React 18.x. The version mismatch caused the react-reconciler to fail at runtime.

## Solution
Downgraded React Three Fiber packages to v8.x versions that are compatible with React 18:

### Installed Versions
- `@react-three/fiber@^8.16.0` (was v9.4.0)
- `@react-three/drei@^9.105.0` (was v10.7.6)
- `@react-three/postprocessing@^2.16.0` (was v3.0.4)

### Commands Used
```bash
# Uninstall incompatible versions
npm uninstall @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei @react-three/postprocessing

# Install React 18 compatible versions
npm install @react-three/fiber@^8.16.0 @react-three/drei@^9.105.0 @react-three/postprocessing@^2.16.0 --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Code Changes
No code changes were required. The API between v8 and v9 is compatible for our use case.

## Verification
- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
- ✅ Dev server starts without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ 3D robot scene renders correctly

## Alternative Solutions
If you want to use React Three Fiber v9 in the future, you would need to:
1. Upgrade React to v19: `npm install react@^19 react-dom@^19`
2. Update Next.js to a version that supports React 19 (Next.js 15+)
3. Test all existing components for React 19 compatibility

## Compatibility Matrix
| React Version | R3F Version | Drei Version | PostProcessing |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| React 18.x   | v8.x        | v9.x         | v2.x           |
| React 19.x   | v9.x        | v10.x        | v3.x           |
