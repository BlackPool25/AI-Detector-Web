## üöÄ How to Get Started

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase
Follow the comprehensive guide in `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`:
1. Create Supabase project
2. Run SQL to create `detection_history` table
3. Create storage buckets (text-uploads, image-uploads, video-uploads)
4. Configure storage policies
5. Set up authentication

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-string
```

See `docs/ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Application
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign Up" to create an account
3. Verify your email (if email confirmation is enabled)
4. Login with your credentials
5. Upload a file from the home page
6. View your detection history in the dashboard

## üìä Database Schema

### Table: detection_history

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| user_id | uuid | Foreign key to auth.users |
| filename | text | Original filename |
| file_type | text | 'text', 'image', or 'video' |
| file_size | bigint | File size in bytes |
| file_extension | text | File extension (e.g., '.txt') |
| file_url | text | Temporary file URL |
| detection_result | text | JSON string of detection result |
| confidence_score | numeric | Confidence percentage |
| model_used | text | Model name (default: 'DetectX-v1') |
| created_at | timestamp | Creation timestamp |
| file_deleted_at | timestamp | When file was deleted |
| is_file_available | boolean | File availability status |

**Indexes:**
- `detection_history_user_id_idx` - Fast user queries
- `detection_history_created_at_idx` - Fast date sorting
- `detection_history_file_available_idx` - Fast cleanup queries

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can only view their own history
- Users can only insert their own records
- Users can only update their own records

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All database operations are user-scoped
- Users cannot access other users' data
- Service role key is only used server-side

### Storage Security
- Files are stored in user-specific folders (`user_id/filename`)
- Storage policies enforce user-based access
- Public URLs expire after cleanup

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Email confirmation (optional)
- Secure session management
- Automatic token refresh

### API Security
- Cron endpoint protected with bearer token
- Service role key stored securely
- Environment variables never exposed to client

## üîÑ File Lifecycle

1. **Upload** - User uploads file through UploadModal
2. **Validation** - File is validated (format, size, MIME type)
3. **Storage** - File uploaded to appropriate Supabase bucket
4. **Detection** - AI detection runs (currently mocked)
5. **Database** - Result saved to `detection_history` table
6. **Display** - User can view result and download file
7. **Cleanup** - After 30 minutes, cron job deletes file and updates database
8. **Archive** - Detection result remains in database (file URL nullified)

## üì± User Journey

### Guest User
1. Browse landing page
2. Click "Try it" on any mode
3. See login prompt
4. Click "Sign Up" ‚Üí Create account
5. Verify email (if enabled)
6. Redirected to dashboard

### Authenticated User
1. Login automatically or manually
2. Navigate to home page
3. Select detection mode (Text/Image/Video)
4. Upload file
5. View detection result
6. Access dashboard to view history
7. Download files (while available)
8. Logout when done

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test the following:

- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Verify email (if enabled)
- [ ] Login with credentials
- [ ] Upload text file (.txt)
- [ ] Upload image file (.jpg, .png)
- [ ] Upload video file (.mp4)
- [ ] View detection result
- [ ] Check dashboard shows upload
- [ ] Download file from dashboard
- [ ] Wait 30+ minutes, verify file deleted
- [ ] Verify detection history still shows
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Try to access dashboard (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Login again (session should persist)

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Mock Detection** - Currently uses simulated AI detection. Replace with actual ML model API in production.

2. **Email Provider** - Uses Supabase's built-in email. For production, configure a custom SMTP provider.

3. **File Storage** - Public buckets used for simplicity. For sensitive content, use private buckets with signed URLs.

4. **Cron Frequency** - Runs every 10 minutes. Adjust in `vercel.json` if needed.

5. **Free Tier Limits** - Supabase free tier has limits on storage, bandwidth, and database rows.

## üîß Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `CRON_SECRET`
4. Deploy
5. Verify cron job is running (check Vercel logs)

### Supabase Production Setup

1. Upgrade to Supabase Pro if needed (for better performance)
2. Configure custom domain
3. Set up custom SMTP for emails
4. Enable email templates
5. Configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
6. Set up database backups
7. Monitor usage and set up alerts

## üéâ What's Next?

1. **Integrate Real AI Model** - Replace mock detection with actual ML API
2. **Add OAuth Providers** - Enable Google, GitHub login
3. **Export History** - Add CSV/PDF export functionality
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Charts and graphs for detection trends
5. **API Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse
6. **Paid Plans** - Implement subscription tiers
7. **Team Collaboration** - Share detections with team members
8. **API Access** - Provide API for developers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "relation 'detection_history' does not exist"
‚Üí Run the SQL script in `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` Step 3

### "new row violates row-level security policy"
‚Üí Ensure you're logged in and RLS policies are created correctly

### "Failed to upload file"
‚Üí Check storage buckets exist and policies are configured

### "Invalid API key"
‚Üí Verify environment variables are correct and restart dev server

### Files not deleting after 30 minutes
‚Üí Check cron job is running in Vercel logs and CRON_SECRET is set
